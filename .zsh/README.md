# Jabba's ZSH settings

This repo contains my own ZSH settings.

For putting my settings together, I used
lots of resources (see links below).

First I tried oh-my-zsh. It was great. It has a very
logical structure and it was very easy to use, but it
was a bit bloated. It contained lots of things that I
don't need.

Then I tried zprezto. It was less bloated but it was
a bit harder to use than oh-my-zsh.

After that I said to myself: "Shit man, use your own
configuration!" :) This contains exactly those things
that I need.
